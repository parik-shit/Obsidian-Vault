1. Frontend:
        * Client-side: Use JavaScript (TypeScript) to handle incoming chat messages from users.
        * Server-side: Use Express to handle incoming requests from the client and interact with the database.
2. Database:
        * Vector Database: Store historical interactions between the user and the chatbot, as well as AI-generated respo

responses.
        * Use a vector database like Milvus to store the interactions in a compact binary format.
3. Language Model (LM):
        * Run a local instance of GPT-3.5 on the server to generate responses to incoming messages.
        * The LM will take in the input message and output a response based on the patterns it has learned from the trai

training data.
4. Security:
        * Implement security measures to protect sensitive user data, such as encrypting communication between the client
and server using SSL/TLS.
        * Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by setting appropriate headers in the server response.

                   +-------------------+
                   | Vector database    |
                   +-------------------+
```
Here's a high-level overview of how the system would work:

1. When a user sends an incoming message, the client-side code will check the vector database for any similar past
interactions. If there are any matches, the client will use those interactions to generate a response without
querying the server.
2. If there are no matching interactions in the vector database, the client will send a request to the server with
the incoming message.
3. The server will retrieve the message from the vector database and process it using the local instance of
GPT-3.5.
4. The server will generate a response based on the patterns learned by the LM and store it in the vector database
for future reference.
5. The server will send the response back to the client.
6. The client will display the response to the user.

By using Milvus as the vector database, you can efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data while taking
up less space than traditional relational databases. Additionally, GPT-3.5 running on the server will allow for
fast and accurate generation of responses based on patterns learned from the training data.
