when we call node and provide a file that we would like to run, what we are effectively doing is running a 'process' .

we can start these processes synchronously and async

#### CHILD_PROCESS

Async
	- `child_process.spawn()`
	- `child_process.exec()`
	- `child_process.execFile()`
	- `child_process.fork()`
Sync
	 - `child_process.spawnSync()`
	 - `child_process.execSync()`
	 - `child_process.execFileSync()`


Events
	- close
	- disconnect
	- error
	- message
	- exit
